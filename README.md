# Public-Utilities-Service-System
This project simulates the operation of a meter polling system for public utilities, such as electricity. 
It emulates real-world communication between utility service providers and metering devices, enabling efficient data collection and analysis. 

Key Features:
✅ Simulated Meter Communication 
✅ Data Storage & Analysis – Stores collected readings for further processing and visualization.
✅ Error Handling & Logging – Detects and logs communication failures or inconsistencies.

This system is ideal for testing and optimizing utility data management solutions before deployment in real-world environments.
